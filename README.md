# What Should I Watch?

"What Should I Watch" is an app developed by Jeff Severson, Maren Hatling, Steve Siegel and Amira Holden.

It is deployed at this link:

This tool makes your day a little less stressful by recommending movies for you to watch and a drink to quench your thirst.

On the page, a user clicks on a movie genre on the left side and recommended movies are returned from The Movie Database API. Another button on the left will return a random cocktail with image and recipe, using The Cocktail Database API. Users also can save movies using localStorage and view a list of their saved choices.

Our team collaborated on this project, working with HTML, Bulma CSS classes, JavaScript, JQuery, the 2 APIs mentioned above and GitHub.
